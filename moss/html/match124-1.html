# Question 2: Comparing Algorithms
"""
Create 10 (more would be better!) random 8-puzzle instances (using your code from above), and solve each of them using the algorithms below. Each algorithm should be run on the exact same set of problems to make the comparison fair.

For each solved problem, record:
	the total running time in seconds
	the length (i.e. number of tiles moved) of the solution
	that total number of nodes that were removed from frontier
You will probably need to make some modifications to the A* code to get all this data.

The algorithms you should test are:
	A*-search using the misplaced tile heuristic (this is the default heuristic in the EightPuzzle class)
	A*-search using the Manhattan distance heuristic. Please implement your own (correctly working!) version of the Manhattan heuristic.
		Be careful: there is an incorrect Manhattan distance function in tests/test_search.py. So don’t use that!
	A*-search using the max of the misplaced tile heuristic and the Manhattan distance heuristic
Summarize all your data in a single table in a spreadsheet as described below.

Based on your data, which algorithm is the best? Explain how you came to your conclusion.

Tiles slide into the blank (the *) as in the regular 8-puzzle, but now the board has a different shape which changes the possible moves.

As in the previous question, test this problem using the same approach, and the same algorithms, as in the previous problem.

Be careful generating random instances: the check_solvability function from the EightPuzzle probably doesn’t work with this board!

Based on your results, how does the Duck-puzzle compare to the 8-puzzle: is it easier, harder, or about the same difficulty?
