Question 1: Helper Functions
Write a function called make_rand_8puzzle() that returns a new instance of an EightPuzzle 
problem with a random initial state that is solvable. Note that EightPuzzle has a method
called check_solvability that you should use to help ensure your initial state is solvable.
Write a function called display(state) that takes an 8-puzzle state 
(i.e. a tuple that is a permutation of (0, 1, 2, …, 8)) as input and prints a neat and readable
representation of it. 0 is the blank, and should be printed as a * character.
For example, if state is (0, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 4, 6, 5), then display(state) should print:
* 3 2
1 8 7
4 6 5

"""
Question 2: Comparing Algorithms
Create 10 (more would be better!) random 8-puzzle instances (using your code from above),
and solve each of them using the algorithms below. Each algorithm should be run on the exact 
same set of problems to make the comparison fair.

For each solved problem, record:
the total running time in seconds
the length (i.e. number of tiles moved) of the solution
that total number of nodes that were removed from frontier
You will probably need to make some modifications to the A* code to get all this data.

Also, be aware that the time it takes to solve random 8-puzzle instances can vary from less than
a second to hundreds of seconds — so solving all these problems might take some time!

The algorithms you should test are:

A*-search using the misplaced tile heuristic (this is the default heuristic in the EightPuzzle class)
A*-search using the Manhattan distance heuristic Please implement your own (correctly working!) 
version of the Manhattan heuristic.
Be careful: there is an incorrect Manhattan distance function in tests/test_search.py. 
So don’t use that!
A*-search using the max of the misplaced tile heuristic and the Manhattan distance heuristic
Summarize all your data in a single table in a spreadsheet as described below.

Based on your data, which algorithm is the best? Explain how you came to your conclusion.

Question 3: The House-Puzzle
(Duck-puzzle) Implement a new Problem class called DuckPuzzle that is the same as the 8-puzzle, except the board has
 this shape (that looks a bit like a duck facing to the left):

 1 2
 3 4 5 6   goal state
   7 8 *
</FONT>Tiles slide into the blank (the *) as in the regular 8-puzzle, but now the board has a different shape which changes 
the possible moves.

As in the previous question, test this problem using the same approach, and the same algorithms, as in the previous
 problem.

Be careful generating random instances: the check_solvability function from the EightPuzzle probably doesn’t work 
with this board!

Based on your results, how does the Duck-puzzle compare to the 8-puzzle: is it easier, harder, or about the same 
difficulty?
