<h2>Reading the Results</h2>

<i> This page is out of date for the new version of moss (in beta
during the summer of 2003).  More up to date information on the results
page can be found on the <a href="../cap/index.html">CAP</a> pages.</i><p>

The main (or index) page consists of a table of pairs of files that
have similar code, sorted by the size of the code that is considered
the same in both files.  The format of a table entry is
<p>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>File1<TH>File2<TH>TokensMatched<TH>LinesMatched
</TABLE>
<p>
Tokens Matched is the number of tokens matched in the two files,
which is the most accurate measure of the size of the match.  
Lines Matched is approximately the number of lines of code that
matched, which is a more intuitive but less reliable measure.  Each
file is also given a percentage score, which is the 
the percentage of the tokens in each file considered
to match tokens in the other file.  For all three measures, higher
numbers mean more code matches.
<p>
For each pair of matches there is a page with information on
particular passages that match.  The window is divided into
three frames: one for a table of all passages that matched, and
one each for the source code of the two files.
<p>
The table of passages has the format
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" BGCOLOR="#d0d0d0"><TR><TH><TH>filename1 (%)<TH>filename2 (%)<TH>Tokens
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#c00000"><FONT COLOR="#c00000">-</FONT><TD>88-99<TD>119-131<TD ALIGN=center>174</FONT>
</TABLE>
where each row gives a range of line numbers from file1 and file2 that are considered to be
the same, along with the size of the passage in tokens.  The line range is a hyperlink to the
appropriate passage in the corresponding program.  The passage has the
color of the small rectangle at the left-hand edge of the row.  In addition, the passage
has an associated <IMG SRC="target.gif">.  Clicking on this icon sets
the focus in the other program frame to the matching passage.
