<h3> What is Moss?</h3> 
Moss is an automatic system for determining
the similarity of two C, C++, Java, or ML programs.  To date, the main
application of Moss has been in detecting cheating in university programming
classes.  Since its development two years ago, Moss has been very
effective in this role and is a significant improvement over other
cheating detection systems (at least, over those known to us).

<h3>An Internet Service (beta test)</h3>
Moss is now being provided as a free Internet service.
The service has been designed to be very easy to use.  You
supply a list of files to compare and Moss does the rest.<p>

The Moss server responds to a query with a list of pairs of programs
that have similar code.  Moss also tells you which passages in the two
programs appear the same, making it easy to quickly compare the files
by hand.  Finally, Moss can automatically eliminate matches to code
that one expects to be shared (e.g., libraries or instructor-supplied
code), thereby eliminating false positives that arise from legitimate
sharing of code.

<h3>Registering for Moss</h3>
Moss is being provided in the hope that it will benefit the
educational community; it is fast, easy to use, and free.  Access to
Moss is currently restricted to instructors in programming courses.
To obtain a Moss account, send a request to <a
href=mailto:"moss-request@cs.berkeley.edu">moss-request@cs.berkeley.edu</a>.
Processing requests for accounts may take up to a day; once you have
an account queries are processed as soon as they are received.

<h3> How Does it Work?</h3>
Wouldn't you like to know!  While there is a big difference between a
good cheating detection algorithm and a bad one, all such algorithms
can be fooled if one knows how they work.  It's best if we don't say
too much about the ideas behind Moss.  Suffice it to say that it is
more sophisticated than systems based on counting the frequency of
certain words in the program text (a widely used cheating-detection
heuristic); Moss actually examines program structure.
