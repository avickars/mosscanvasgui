Below are various perl scripts for submitting queries
to the Moss server.  If you are having problems with
your queries, please download and try the latest
script.<p>

To replace an existing script, you will need
to copy the user id from your old script to the
new one.  Look for a line<p>
$userid=987654321;<p>
in the new script.  Simply replace the number
with the user id from your old script and then
follow the usual installation instructions.
